# Welcome, reader!

This repository contains an example on using a random forest algorithm to perform feature selection on microbiome data. It uses a small portion of the data from the MICROP project. these examples were designed to be of use to staff and students from the ENtomology department of Wageningen University, to support a seminar on the use of AI in research and science.

To get started, run the RProject file. you should have Rstudio installed. Open the RandomForestExample.Rmd markdown file in the /Code folder. install the packages defined in the first chunk of the code R markdown document that will run the code.

Run the code from start to end, using the presentation and the rendered markdown htlm in the /Docs folder as guidelines. The whole process should only take a few minutes!
