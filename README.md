# Welcome, reader!

This repository contains an example on using a random forest algorithm to perform feature selection on microbiome data. It uses a small portion of the data from the MICROP project. these examples were designed to be of use to staff and students from the ENtomology department of Wageningen University, to support a seminar on the use of AI in research and science.

To get started, simply run the RProject file. you should have Rstudio installed. Then, install the packages defined in the first chunk of the code R markdown document that will run the code.
Run the code from start to end. it should only take a few minutes
