# load microbiome data as a phyloseq object

a phyloseq object is only a data container, with layers for the feature table (ASVs/OTUs), microbial taxonomies, sample metadata, and reference sequences. 


```{r}
# load object
load("./Data/ps_rarefied.Rdata")

#check ps object
ps_rarefied # full ps object
otu_table(ps_rarefied)[1:5,1:5] # otu table 
tax_table(ps_rarefied)[1:5,] # taxonomy 
ps_rarefied@sam_data [1:5,1:5]# metadata

#let's take a quick look on an oridnation  in this dataset
plot_ordination(ps_rarefied, 
                ordination = ordinate(ps_rarefied, "NMDS", "bray"),
                type="samples",

# put data into a format boruta will udenrstand

We will try to predict the variable "Stress", present in our metadata, by using the abudannces of bacteria. "Stress" this refers to the stress treatments we applied to the plants in a greenhouse experiment with different plant species

for classification tasks in borutas, a most critical part of the df is having the variable that you want to predict as a factor. also, make sure you don't ahve NAs, NaN, or empty values in your df

```{r}


# put that microbiome data into a df format that boruta will understand
df_for_boruta_stress<-single_physeq_to_borutaInput(physeq_object = ps_rarefied,
                                             variable_to_be_classified = "Stress")[,-1] # [,-1] removes first column, "sample" as a predictor 

#check the object you have
df_for_boruta_stress[45:55,1:10]
str(df_for_boruta_stress)

#are tehre any NAs?
any(is.na(df_for_boruta_stress))

#is the first column a factor?
is.factor(df_for_boruta_stress[,1])
df_for_boruta_stress[,1]

```

# run boruta

on a 2016 HP Zbook (4 cores, 16GB ram) this takes ~ 4.4 minutes
```{r}

set.seed(101) # set a fixed seed to have reproducible results
boruta_output_stress<-  Boruta(Stress~.,   # classification to predict
                           data = df_for_boruta_stress, # your df with the variable you want to predict

                           ntree = 20000) # size of the forest

# check precision in the predicion of our model with caret

There are many ways to carefully split your data according your experiemntal design. here we will simply ballance according species
```{r}

 # define training and test set. 
  trainIndex<- createDataPartition(df_for_boruta_stress[,1], 
                                   p = .70, 
                                   list = FALSE, 
                                   times = 1)
  # set train and test sets
  data_Train <- df_for_boruta_stress [ trainIndex,]
  data_Test  <- df_for_boruta_stress [-trainIndex,]
  
  #check training and testing sets
  data_Train[30:40,1:10]
  data_Test[30:40,1:10]
  str(data_Test)

```



# train the model
Boruta found the  most important features, but it won't classify new data for you. you have to train the random forest with those boruta-selected features to make a model and test it
```{r}
# define training with 5-folde cross validation repeated 10 times
train.control <- caret::trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", # set trainig/data split 
                                     number = 5,
                                     repeats = 20,
                                     allowParallel = TRUE)
    
#train the model. A small forest with 500 trees takes only a minute
model_borutized <- caret::train(form = boruta_output_stress_fixed_formula, # boruta formula
                                data = data_Train, # training data
                                method = "rf", #  training based on RF
                                trControl = train.control, # defined in trainControl() above
                                ntree=2500) # the more trees, the more precision

#check the trained model
model_borutized

#check your confusion matrix. keep in mind thsi was your traiing set! you should test the model in a new datset the trainer has not seen
confusionMatrix(data =model_borutized )

```


# test the model

```{r}

#predict the labels of your test set
prediction<-stats::predict(object = model_borutized,
                           newdata = data_Test) 

#check if predictions match the true labels
confusion_output<-confusionMatrix(data = prediction, 
                                  reference = data_Test[,1])
 
confusion_output
```


# streamlining the process

This two chunks reproduce the entire pipeline above, twice. edit the custom functions on ./Code/Machine_Learning_custom_functions.R to adapt this to otehr datasets besides microbiome data inside a phyloseq object

```{r message=FALSE}

                color="Stress",
                shape = "Sp_full_name")+ 
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(19, 1, 3)) + 
  theme_bw()+

# split the original object by greenhouse comaprtment
ps_stress_l<-  phyloseq_sep_variable(ps_rarefied,variable = c("greenhouse_compartment"))

# run boruta on both sample sets
set.seed(101)
Boruta_stress_l<-lapply(ps_stress_l, function (x)
